      <p>Favorite Vacation Spots
        <br><br>
        One of my favorite places to go on vacation is New York City. My brother has lived there since I was very young, and so I have had the opportunity to visit him fairly frequently. He owns a house in Brooklyn, which is a really nice part of New York. I love being able to take the subway anywhere I want throughout the city, getting the opportunity to explore and discover new things about it.

          <h2>Gabe Campbell</h2>
          Hi, my name is Gabe Campbell; I am college student majoring in Computer Science, and I hope to one day become a software engineer. While going to school, I also work part time as a server and bartender, which gives me a fairly decent income. I live with my roommate Diante and his dog Kai. My <strong>favorite</strong> type of food is pizza; I could eat it all day (if it weren't so unhealthy). My favorite movie is <em>Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</em>.

      <p>There are several different attributes to img tags</p>
